## **Covid-19 Impacts Analysis: Questionnaire**

### **1. Objective**
- What is the goal of this analysis?  
  *To study the spread of Covid-19 and its economic impacts across various countries using Python.*

---

### **2. Dataset**
- What data is required for this analysis?  
  *The analysis uses two datasets:*
  - *Transformed data (`transformed_data.csv`): Contains processed Covid-19 data with columns like country code, human development index (HDI), total cases, total deaths, stringency index, population, and GDP per capita.*
  - *Raw data (`raw_data.csv`): Contains unprocessed data with additional details such as total cases and deaths per day.*

- Where can the dataset be obtained?  
  *The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.*

---

### **3. Tools and Software Required**
- Which programming language will be used?  
  *Python*

- What libraries are necessary for this analysis?  
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `plotly.express` and `plotly.graph_objects`: For creating visualizations.

- What software setup is needed?  
  - Install Python (version 3.x recommended).
  - Install necessary libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas plotly
    ```

### **4. Steps in the Analysis**
#### **Step 1: Data Preparation**
- How do you load the datasets?  
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  data = pd.read_csv("transformed_data.csv")
  data2 = pd.read_csv("raw_data.csv")
  ```

- How do you inspect the datasets?  
  ```python
  print(data.head())
  print(data2.head())
  ```

#### **Step 2: Data Aggregation**
- How do you combine and preprocess the datasets?  
  - Aggregate columns like HDI, total cases, total deaths, stringency index, and population.
  - Use `value_counts()` to analyze sample distributions across countries.
  ```python
  aggregated_data = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(code, country, hdi, tc, td, sti, population)), 
                                 columns=["Country Code", "Country", "HDI", "Total Cases", 
                                          "Total Deaths", "Stringency Index", "Population"])
  ```

#### **Step 3: Selecting Top Countries**
- How do you select countries with the highest Covid-19 cases?  
  ```python
  top_countries = aggregated_data.sort_values(by=["Total Cases"], ascending=False).head(10)
  ```

#### **Step 4: Adding GDP Data**
- How do you include GDP before and during Covid-19?
  ```python
  top_countries["GDP Before Covid"] = [65279.53, ...] # Add manual values
  top_countries["GDP During Covid"] = [63543.58, ...] # Add manual values
  ```

#### **Step 5: Visualizations**
1. **Spread of Covid-19**:
   - Bar chart for total cases by country:
     ```python
     import plotly.express as px
     figure = px.bar(top_countries, y='Total Cases', x='Country', title="Countries with Highest Covid Cases")
     figure.show()
     ```
   - Bar chart for total deaths:
     ```python
     figure = px.bar(top_countries, y='Total Deaths', x='Country', title="Countries with Highest Deaths")
     figure.show()
     ```

2. **Economic Impacts**:
   - Compare GDP before and during Covid-19:
     ```python
     import plotly.graph_objects as go
     fig = go.Figure()
     fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=top_countries["Country"], y=top_countries["GDP Before Covid"], name='Before Covid'))
     fig.add_trace(go.Bar(x=top_countries["Country"], y=top_countries["GDP During Covid"], name='During Covid'))
     fig.update_layout(barmode='group')
     fig.show()
     ```

3. **Stringency Index**:
   - Visualize how strictly countries followed measures:
     ```python
     figure = px.bar(top_countries, x='Country', y='Stringency Index', title="Stringency Index during Covid-19")
     figure.show()
     ```

4. **Human Development Index (HDI)**:
   - Analyze HDI during Covid-19:
     ```python
     figure = px.bar(top_countries, x='Country', y='HDI', title="Human Development Index during Covid-19")
     figure.show()
     ```

5. **Death Rate Calculation**:
   - Calculate death rate across all countries:
     ```python
     death_rate = (top_countries["Total Deaths"].sum() / top_countries["Total Cases"].sum()) * 100
     print("Death Rate =", death_rate)
     ```

---

### **5. Outputs**
- What are the expected outputs?
  - Visual insights into the spread of Covid-19 (total cases and deaths).
  - Economic impact through GDP comparisons.
  - Stringency index performance by country.
  - Human development index trends.

---

### **6. Conclusion**
- What conclusions can be drawn from this analysis?
  *The analysis highlights how different countries were impacted by Covid-19 in terms of health outcomes (cases and deaths) and economic factors (GDP per capita). It also provides insights into government responses via stringency indices.*
